# Flight Rules for `dotfiles`: Configuration Quirks

## What are "flight rules"?

A guide for astronauts about what to do when things go wrong.

## `grub` and booting

### Screen flickers when computer is booting from cold start.

This may be an issue with using the NVIDIA driver vs. the Intel driver to run
graphics. The NVIDIA driver has been seen to flicker, while the Intel driver
does not.

In order to switch drivers, run command:

```bash
sudo prime-select intel
sudo reboot
```

See `python3` script `$(which prime-select)` or `/usr/bin/prime-select` for more
details.

NOTE: CUDA is not available in this mode. Switch to NVIDIA drivers using `sudo
prime-select nvidia` when CUDA is needed.

### BIOS does not boot "Windows Boot Manager" properly.

This may be an issue with `grub` precedence and preferences. Apparently, `grub`
preferences may override BIOS / UEFI settings, such that "Windows Boot Manager"
cannot be selected from the BIOS. Install program `grub-customizer`, and in the
"General Settings" tab, under option "visibility", check "show menu" and "look
for other operating systems". Then, click button "Save" to run `update-grub`.

### `grub` keeps booting into the `grub` menu.

If Ubuntu is the only operating system on the machine, Ubuntu will not boot into
the `grub` menu by default. However, if multiple operating systems exist on the
machine, Ubuntu will boot into the `grub` menu by default. In order to avoid
this, install program `grub-customizer`, and in the "General Settings" tab,
under option visibility, uncheck "show menu" and "look for other operating
systems". Then, click button "Save" to run `update-grub`.

## Drivers

### `nvidia-smi` is not referenceable, even though drivers are installed.

This may be an issue with booting into the OS with the Intel driver vs. the
NVIDIA driver. If the system is running with Intel drivers, the NVIDIA drivers
are not available.

In order to switch drivers, run command:

```bash
sudo prime-select nvidia
sudo reboot
```

Now, `nvidia-smi` should return the console.

NOTE: NVIDIA drivers cause flicker upon boot. Run only when CUDA is necessary
and switch back to `intel` otherwise.

### Microphone does not work, even though device is recognized

According to [the Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 2
specifications](https://psref.lenovo.com/syspool/Sys/PDF/ThinkPad/ThinkPad_P1_2nd_Gen/ThinkPad_P1_2nd_Gen_Spec.PDF),
the laptop has built-in Dolby Audio Premium microphone/speaker combination.
According to [this Stack Overflow answer](https://askubuntu.com/a/984118), Dolby
drivers do not exist for Ubuntu:

In order to use a microphone on Ubuntu Linux, buy an external microphone.
Otherwise, boot into the separate Windows partition using the Windows Boot
Manager.

## Miscallaneous

### I want to download a playlist from YouTube with highest quality video/audio

Run this command:

```bash
youtube-dl \
    -o '%(playlist)s/%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s' \ # Format title of videos.
    -f 'bestvideo[ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]/mp4' \ # Download as '.mp4', sync and splice best quality audio/video separately as they may be in separate files.
    https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=${PLAYLIST} # ${PLAYLIST} is playlist ID.
```
