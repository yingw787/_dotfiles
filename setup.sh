# This script is intended to be hosted at https://dotfiles.yingw787.com for
# configuring Ying's personal development setup.
#
# Assumptions:
# - Using Ubuntu Desktop 19.10.0 64-bit build
# - Internet is reachable
# - User has `sudo` privileges (e.g. is root)
#
# Usage:
# - cat setup.sh | bash (for basic setup)
# - bash setup.sh

# WARNING: This could be dangerous if `git` breaks backwards compatibility.
# However, no `git` builds are available for specific versions, only release
# candidate and stable PPAs are available. The only way to lock in a specific
# version is to build `git` from source, which I do not think is necessary at
# this time.
