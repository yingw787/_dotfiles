# WARNING: This could be dangerous if `git` breaks backwards compatibility.
# However, no `git` builds are available for specific versions, only release
# candidate and stable PPAs are available. The only way to lock in a specific
# version is to build `git` from source, which I do not think is necessary at
# this time.
